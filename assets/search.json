        "content": "This is the first post in a series of three presenting the DICOM standard. We’ll cover the basic understandind of DICOM, starting with the DICOM Image Structure, the DICOM Information Model and DICOM Communication Model. Let’s start!\n\nIntroduction\n\nDICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and is the international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process, and display medical imaging information. It’s the standard behing radiology equipment, networking servers and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).\n\nYou can think about it in this way: You have different entities (image-acquisition devices, PACS, workstations, etc.) playing different roles in the Healthcare world and DICOM is the standard that allows these entities to exchange information, i.e., interoperability.\n\nThe History\n\nIn the beginning of the 80’s, it was almost impossible for anyone other than manufacturers of CT and MRI devices to read and decode the images produced by the device. In 1983 the American College of Radiology and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association worked together and estabilished a standards committee to meets the combined needs of radiologists, physicists and equipment vendors. Then, in 1985 the first version of DICOM was released with name ACR-NEMA 300. The second version of the ACR-NEMA 300 came out in 1988 and gained increased acceptance among vendors. Only in 1993 the third version came out and was finally named as DICOM. The name changed because the Cardiologists entered in the game too and a name which contains only radiologists (ACR) would not make the cardiologists happy. There was a war a that time. The DICOM 3.0 from 1993 had 9 parts of the standard and the current version, which is still 3.0, incorporated 10 new parts and 210 supplements.\n\nDICOM Image Structure\n\nTo understand DICOM, the first thing that we need to know is how the standard defines a DICOM Image.\n",
